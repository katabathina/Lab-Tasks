Today Task:

1.Create a VPC
2.Create IGW and attache to VPC.
3.create a subnest based on AZ's
  public subnets and private subnets.
4.Create a routing table(private & public)
 
All public subnets only one route.
private subnests each one route

publicsubnets each one make auto assign default=enable
privatesubnets auto matically auto assign default=Disable

 Associate (add) public subnets to public route.
 Associate (add) private subnets to each route.


goto public routetable and edit and add publicsubnets and save.

goto private routable each and edit and add privatesubnets.



goto routetable and selece public route and click route and edit and add anotherroute
 
 like 0.0.0.0/0 and igw id and save.


Create NAT Gateway.

Create NAT Gateway (Public Zone-A)-EIP:nat-06484780d71e5cf10'.

Create NAT Gateway (Public Zone-B)-EIP:nat-03fdca6a5653bfadc'.


goto routetable and selece private route-a and click route and edit and add anotherroute
 
 like 0.0.0.0/0 and NAT-a-ID and save.

goto routetable and selece private route-b and click route and edit and add anotherroute
 
 like 0.0.0.0/0 and NAT-b-ID and save.


	Afterthat create security groups:-

1.Bastion-ssh -22-anywhers(Bastion-sg)

2. elb-http-80-anywhere(0.0.0.0/0)_(elb-sg)


3.webservers-22-ssh-(Bastion-sg)
           http-80-(elb-sg)

After that create 4 instances
2 public and 2 privates
like {2 basiton(public az-a and public az-b) and 2 webservers (private az-a and private az-b)}

for basitons give one security group(Bastion-sg) and Webservers sg(Bastion-sg & elb-sg).



Afterthat create alb;

attache (elb-sg) and then create a tg(target group)

add instance public
