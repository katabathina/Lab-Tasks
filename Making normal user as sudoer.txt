The sudo command offers a mechanism for providing trusted users with administrative access to a system without sharing the password of the root user. When users given access via this mechanism precede an administrative command with sudo they are prompted to enter their own password. Once authenticated, and assuming the command is permitted, the administrative command is executed as if run by the root user.
Follow this procedure to create a normal user account and give it sudo access. You will then be able to use the sudo command from this user account to execute administrative commands without logging in to the account of the root user.

First create normal user from "root" user :useradd testuser
creat a password :passwd sreedhar
enterpassword:XXXXXXXXX
re-enterpassword:XXXXXXXX

goto:visudo
