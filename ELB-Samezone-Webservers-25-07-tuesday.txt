Step 8:-

Create new "load balancer" there you add security group(SG)

Which you created intially ex:-sgelb

after that add 2 webserver instances and confirm.

next come to the loadbalancer(LB) description

select DNS Name ex:-"testelb1-2049490580.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com" and copy,

Come to web browser give this DNS Name ex:-testelb1-2049490580.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com.
